## What you should know about me

I am Abhik, a Software Engineer living in New York City since 2017! 

## Where did I study

Completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from the Indian Institute Of Technology, Madras in India in 2015 and then got my Masters in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon Univerity in 2016.

## What am I good at

Experienced with building large scale microservices-based applications and distrbuted systems. My recent hands-on experience has been in C++, Python, Javascript, Kafka and RabbitMQ. I am good with numbers and remembering data.

Have been an avid tennis fan since childhood and play in a few recreational leagues in New York while at the same time trying to better my skiing skills.

## What you should know more about me
I am a twin, older than my sister by 2 minutes and speak a few languages including English, Hindi and Bengali.

Like collecting socks from different places I visit and have a dislocated middle finger which was never rectified since a field incident in 2007.

If not a software engineer, would have tried applying for a sports statistician job. I once told an interviewer I remember all the tennis grand slam champions in the past 20 years, he picked a random grand slam tournament and year from the 90s and I got it right, still didn't the internship job!
